    "I am a highly visual person. When I have to learn something new, I
    usually first try to make a sketch of the structure of the knowledge that
    I want (or have to ;-)) to study. This usually results in diagrams
    outlining the material, giving it some structured form that makes it
    easier for me to grasp. "

    "In this case the nodes in the network are wikipedia articles and the
    edges are the links between articles.  We then ... used an algorithm to lay
    out all 650,000 nodes (wikipedia articles) that had at least one link in
    such a way that similar articles are near one another.  These are the
    yellow dots, which when viewed at low res give a yellow tint to the whole
    picture."

    data analysis tool devised to solve such problems of History Flow.
    Second, this tool is used to actually visualize the Wiki revision history

    revision history and the relationship and conflict structures between the
    authors based on the results of the MDS analysis."

    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Geographical_coordinates">georeferences</a>.
    Georeferences are a way to annotate geographic landmarks, borders,
    [and] cities within Wikipedia articles ... Wikipedia Worldview is
    an app to project Wikipedia georeferences onto a 2D plane,
    intended to analyze the language-based distribution."

    "The clustering component of this visualization is vital. The
    mere presence of information isn't all that interesting; there is no
    context or relevance to be gleaned. However, the structure of information
    is revealing about where fields intersect and diverge, and ultimately
    about how humans organize information."

    "Since geography is never far from history, a lot of maps show
    the colonial past of many countries. As ethnic groups don’t always fall
    inside political borders, several maps reveal the presence of multiple
    ethnic or cultural groups within a country or of groups stretching across
    borders."
